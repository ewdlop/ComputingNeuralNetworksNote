Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain's interconnected neurons, designed to recognize patterns and solve complex problems. Various types of neural networks have been developed, each suited to specific tasks and data types. Here are some common types:

:::contextList

**Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)**  
The simplest form of neural network where connections between nodes do not form cycles. Information moves in one direction—from input nodes, through hidden nodes (if any), to output nodes. Commonly used for straightforward tasks like image classification.

**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**  
Specialized for processing data with grid-like topology, such as images. CNNs use convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features, making them highly effective for image and video recognition tasks.

**Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**  
Designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data by utilizing loops within the network, allowing information to persist. RNNs are particularly effective for tasks like language modeling and time-series prediction.

**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**  
A type of RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies, addressing the vanishing gradient problem. LSTMs are well-suited for tasks that require understanding context over extended sequences, such as speech recognition and text generation.

**Autoencoder**  
An unsupervised learning model that aims to learn a compressed representation of data, typically for dimensionality reduction or feature learning. Autoencoders are used in applications like anomaly detection and image denoising.

**Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**  
Consists of two networks—a generator and a discriminator—that compete against each other. GANs are used to generate realistic synthetic data, such as images and videos, and have applications in data augmentation and creative arts.

**Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN)**  
A type of feedforward neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation functions. RBFNs are typically used for function approximation, time-series prediction, and control systems.

**Transformer**  
A neural network architecture that relies on self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences in parallel, rather than sequentially. Transformers have become the foundation for many state-of-the-art models in natural language processing, such as BERT and GPT.

Each type of neural network has its unique architecture and is chosen based on the specific requirements of the task at hand.
